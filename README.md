# Setup

The codes for scraping and parsing were adapted from the original codes used in Pico et al. (2020). Installation instructions are copied from their repository.

## Basic setup instructions

First set up a virtual environment in the top level of this repo and
source it

```
$ virutalenv venv
```
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, pip install the requirements.txt (note: this file is not updated!)

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now install a notebook kernel that will use this virtual environment

```
$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv
```

Run the jupyter notebook server, and to use these notebooks select the
kernel named `venv` (or whatever you chose as a name).

## WebDriver

The webdriver we used with selenium is included in this repo under the
`deps` directory. It is compatible with Google Chrome versions 70-73.
Other versions of chromedrivers can be [downloaded here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
